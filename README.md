# Financial-Data---Ethical-Considerations
In this project, assess the ethical risks associated with financial data. These risks may occur as a result of model failures, financial crises (e.g. recession), undesirable simulation results, or ethical challenges. Additionally, we propose sustainable solutions to these problems and help the financial and risk management team make decisions.
